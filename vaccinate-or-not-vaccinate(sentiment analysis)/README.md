## To Vaccinate or Not to Vaccinate: Itâ€™s not a Question

This hackathon was hosted by ZindiAfrica. 

The objective of this challenge was to develop a machine learning model to assess if a Twitter post related to vaccinations is positive, neutral, or negative. This solution could help governments and other public health actors monitor public sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccinations and help improve public health policy, vaccine communication strategies, and vaccination programs across the world.
